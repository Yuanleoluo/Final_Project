    "For a long time, car collisions have been the center of commuter's stress points. And since everyone owns a car in the US, the statement that most Americans are also commuters is hardly an understatement. Whether if the collision happens to us, our loved ones, or a stranger it all affects us equally financially or emotionally or just getting stuck in traffic. Hence we are all stakeholders here. So what conditions can cause collision? Can we avoid it? And let's face it, since collisions happen so frequently, if we can't completely avoid it, can we at least choose an option that minimizes the severity?"
